Student Order Management
========================

Student Order Creation
----------------------
We need to allow a student to create a new order.

Student Order Listing
---------------------
We need to allow a student to see all orders he has.

This page must pass the W3C Markup Validation Service. http://validator.w3.org/

Style is not our concern at this moment.

Student Order Detail
--------------------
We need to allow an user to see the detail about an order.

What a student can do with an order depends on the status of the order. An
order has the following status:

- shopping
- submitted
- processing
- ordered
- shipping
- arrived

### shopping ###

A student can:

- See the detail of the order
- Delete the order.

- Change the quantity of a book.
- Remove a book from the order.
