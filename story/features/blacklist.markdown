Blacklist Management
====================

Black User Listing
------------------
We need to allow a user to see all black users he has added.

This page must pass the W3C Markup Validation Service. http://validator.w3.org/

Style is not our concern at this moment.

Add Black User
--------------
We need to allow a user to add another user to his black list.

Remove Black User
-----------------
We need to allow a user to remove another user to his black list.
