Message Management
==================

Message Creation
-----------------
We need to allow an user to write a message to another user.

Message Listing
---------------
We need to allow an user to see all messages he has sent and received. Sent
messages and received messages are separated. Message from black users are
separated.

This page must pass the W3C Markup Validation Service. http://validator.w3.org/

Style is not our concern at this moment.

Message Detail
--------------
We need to allow an user to see details about a message.

In this detail page, an user can reply or delete the message.
